  <p class="faqInf">FAQ</p>
  <p class="faqInfSpec">Welcome to Gifty! Below are some common questions that people asked me.</p>
  <p class="faqInf">How do I add a gift to my list?</p>
  <p class="faqInfSpec">On the "Home" page, you can click or tap the "Add Gift" button to add a gift to your list.
    You will be brought to another page where you can fill out any necessary information that will help others
    find the gift you are asking for.</p>
  <p class="faqInf">How do I invite friends to see my list?</p>
  <p class="faqInfSpec">On the "Invite" page, you can click or tap the "Send Invite" button to invite a friend
    to your friend list. You will need your friend's user name in order to invite them, so be sure that you type it in
    correctly. Otherwise the system will not know which user you are trying to invite. Once they accept your friend
    request, their name will be added to your "Lists" and "Invites" page and will be able to see your list.</p>
  <p class="faqInf">How do I view someone else's friend list?</p>
  <p class="faqInfSpec">Once you have some friends on your friend list, the "Lists" page will show anyone that has
    accepted your friend request. If you click on their name and they have gifts in their list, you will be brought
    to their friend list. On this page you can click on each gift to see details and you can choose to buy/unbuy
    a gift. That user will not see that you bought that gift, though, so you don't have to worry about them finding out!</p>
  <p class="faqInf">How do I remove a friend from my friend list?</p>
  <p class="faqInfSpec">Once you have some friends on your friend list, the "Invites" page will show anyone that has
    accepted your friend request. If you click on their name, you will be shown their public account details. In
    addition, you can click on "Remove Access" to remove that user from your friend list.</p>
  <p class="faqInf">Something went wrong and I'm not sure why! (or) I have a suggestion to improve Gifty!</p>
  <p class="faqInfSpec">If you are in need of assistance or just want to send me a suggestion, feel free to email me
    below! An email dialog will automatically pop up for you with some example text filled in. Thanks for helping me
    make this app better!</p><br/><br/>
