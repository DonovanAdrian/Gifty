# Welcome to the config file!
# Below is an example config to show you what your config file *should* look like!
# As far as I know, Google's Firebase has moved on from using "configs", so this is more
# of a legacy way of doing things. If you wish to still make your own "Gifty" work based
# off of a config similar to the one below, you may have to do some extra leg work on your
# own! Good luck!
#
# PS, use those "#" to make comments here if you need to! Otherwise the website will likely
# be unable to properly read the file. Thanks!
