## Welcome!

This website is meant to be a gift list registry that 
aims at eliminating the double-buying of gifts. My personal 
goal here was to offer something to my family that would 
give an extra layer of confidence when buying gifts for each 
other. In order to complete this, I utilized Google Firebase 
to follow through with all database operations, while I 
handled all the data operations on the front end.


## How Well Does This Work?

As of the current moment in time, this iteration of Gifty is 
not fully operational. However, the previous iteration of 
Gifty is operational, but not at its full potential. When I 
initially created Gifty, I was on a time crunch to translate
the Android application into a website format. As a result, 
some of the code is sloppy and inefficient. This second 
iteration is a means of righting my wrongs and starting anew.


## What Are Some Possible Use Cases For This Program

As mentioned before, the primary use for this program is to 
be utilized as a gift list registry for my family. The goal 
was to completely eliminate the double-buying of gifts 
year-to-year over the holidays. It should be noted that I 
have no current plans to release this to the world besides 
this post on GitHub. As a result, security is minimal with a 
username and a pin, which is encoded into my own simple 
algorithm so that I can't read the pins if I need to access 
the database manually. If I ever released this to the world, 
my main priority would be to switch to Google's own 
authentication system. If Google's database becomes a paid 
service, however, then I would need to create my own local 
database.


## Do You Have Any Other Plans For This Program?

At this time, I am in the progress of updating the original 
files that I utilized over the past holiday season. This 
includes a sizeable list of tasks that need to be addressed, 
some of these tasks are listed below, but here is a more 
concrete idea of my goals with updating each page:
- Remove unnecessary comments and console prints
- Improve simplicity, readability, and efficiency
- Organize any global variables
